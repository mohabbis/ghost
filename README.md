# 👻 Ghost

Your **smart AI parrot helper/geek** — an intelligent desktop companion that watches what you do, learns your patterns, and proactively helps with repetitive tasks.

Like a clever parrot, Ghost observes your behavior silently and pops up with suggestions: *"Hey, I noticed you copy-paste customer info every morning — want me to automate that?"* It's more than just recording/replaying inputs; it's an active assistant that understands your workflow and offers help before you even ask.

> Early stage. The observe/learn/assist engine works; the AI layer is getting smarter.

## What is Ghost?

Ghost is your **smart AI parrot** — an intelligent assistant that:
- **Observes** your desktop activity silently, learning your unique patterns
- **Learns** what workflows you repeat and when you do them
- **Assists** proactively with "Hey, I noticed you..." style suggestions
- **Automates** repetitive tasks so you can focus on what matters

It sits on top of macOS Accessibility (and Windows UIA) to understand your clicks, keystrokes, and workflow intent — then turns those actions into reliable automations.

## How it helps (like a smart parrot)

1. **Observe** — Your parrot silently watches your desktop activity, learning your unique patterns
2. **Learn** — It builds understanding of your intent and recognizes when you repeat actions  
3. **Assist** — Pops up with proactive suggestions: "Hey, I noticed you ___"

- **Frontend** (`src/`) — plain vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, no bundler. The UI for recording and
  replaying lives here and talks to Rust over Tauri IPC. Also serves as the static marketing
  site when deployed to Vercel or Netlify, featuring the smart AI parrot demo.
- **Backend** (`src-tauri/`) — Rust. The platform-specific integration:
  - **macOS** — `src-tauri/src/platform/macos.rs`: CGEventTap for recording, AXUIElement for
    element lookup, enigo for replay.
  - **Windows** — `src-tauri/src/platform/windows.rs`: Win32 hooks for recording, UIA for
    element lookup, enigo for replay.
  - **Engine** — `src-tauri/src/engine.rs`: Platform-agnostic orchestration with atomic
    cancellation support.

## Deployment

### Vercel (Marketing Site)

The `src/` directory contains a static site that can be deployed to Vercel:

1. Push to GitHub
2. Import project in Vercel
3. Set build command: `echo 'Static site - no build required'`
4. Set output directory: `src`

Or use the included `vercel.json` configuration.

### Netlify (Marketing Site)

Alternatively deploy to Netlify using the included `netlify.toml`:

```bash
netlify deploy --prod
```

### Tauri Desktop App

Build a distributable `.app` / `.dmg` (macOS) or `.exe` / `.msi` (Windows):

```bash
cargo tauri build
```

## Requirements

- macOS or Windows
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs) (stable)
- [Tauri CLI](https://tauri.app/start/) — `cargo install tauri-cli`

## Develop

```bash
cargo tauri dev          # run the app (Vite-less; serves src/ directly)
```

Or work with the backend directly:

```bash
cd src-tauri
cargo check              # fast type-check
cargo clippy             # lint
cargo build --release    # build the library
```

## Granting Accessibility (macOS)

Ghost needs **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility** enabled for the app to
watch and replay clicks. On first run, click **Grant Access** in the UI.

> Heads up: in `cargo tauri dev` the dev binary path changes between rebuilds, so macOS may
> re-prompt or drop the permission. A stable build from `cargo tauri build` is more reliable
> for testing real recording.

## Architecture

### Core Modules

- `core/events.rs` — Shared event schema: `InputEvent`, `ElementInfo`, `KeyAction`
- `core/traits.rs` — Platform-agnostic traits: `InputRecorder`, `ElementLocator`, `ReplayEngine`
- `engine.rs` — `GhostEngine` orchestrates backends with thread-safe mpsc channels
- `platform/macos.rs` — macOS implementation using CGEventTap, AXUIElement, enigo
- `platform/windows.rs` — Windows implementation using Win32 hooks, UIA, enigo
- `commands.rs` — Tauri 2 IPC handlers with mpsc→Tauri bridge emitting `ghost:event`

### Event Flow

1. Frontend calls `start_recording()` via Tauri IPC
2. Engine spawns native recorder (CGEventTap/Win32 hook) on background thread
3. Native events flow through mpsc channel → bridge thread → `app.emit("ghost:event", payload)`
4. Frontend receives events via `listen("ghost:event", callback)`
5. Replay uses enigo with AtomicBool cancellation for instant stop
